Why nullable types were introduced :
	because they help to represent a novalue or the absence of a value in value types, enhancing code safety and readability.
	this helps us to avoid using sentinal values (like -1 or 0 for representing emptiness) which can lead to bugs and confusion.Scenarios where nullable types are preferred	1. Database operations: When dealing with databases, fields can often be null. Nullable types allow developers to represent these database fields accurately in their code.	2. Optional parameters: In methods where certain parameters are optional, nullable types can be used to indicate that a parameter may not have a value.	3. Data transfer objects (DTOs): When transferring data between layers or services, nullable types can help represent fields that may not always have a value.	4. User input: In scenarios where user input is involved, nullable types can be used to handle cases where the user may not provide a value for certain fields.
