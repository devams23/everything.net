**Entity Framework is an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for .NET that allows developers to work with databases using C# objects instead of writing raw SQL queries.**



##### Key Features of Entity Framework



* Uses LINQ to Entities for querying databases with C# syntax.
* Supports automatic database schema generation from models.
* Provides change tracking and lazy loading.
* Reduces the need for raw SQL, making code more readable.
* Supports multiple database providers like SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.



##### Entity Framework ***Core***



* EF Core uses a provider-based model, which allows different database types to be plugged in and used with the same EF Core programming model (LINQ, change tracking, etc.)
* Modern Entity Framework Core (EF Core) has an extensible architecture that supports various data stores, including NoSQL databases.
