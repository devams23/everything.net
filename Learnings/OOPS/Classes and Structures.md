Classes and Structures have the following basic differences −



classes are reference types and structs are value types

structures do not support inheritance

structures cannot have default constructor





Access specifiers specify the access rules for the members as well as the class itself. If not mentioned, then the ***default access specifier for a class type is internal***. 
*Default access for the members is private.*
